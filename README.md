**What needed to be done:**

- Use the most_popular_api (you'll need to obtain a key to work with it).
- The home screen should have three tabs (most emailed, most shared, most viewed) with a list of articles for each category. - When clicking on an article in the list, open a detailed article screen.
- Perform the selection for a specific month.
- Implement the ability to add to favorites. Favorites should have a separate screen or tab and should be available offline.
- The project should be uploaded to GitHub.

**What was expected to see:**
- Well-structured code.
- Local data storage using CoreData.
- Alamofire for network requests.
- Pods.
